<!-- ## About Me -->
I am a first-year Master's student in computer science at [SCIR](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/)(Research Center for Social Computing and Information Retrieval) in [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/), supervised by Yu Zhang. My primary research interests lies in the area of in Natural Language Processing. Recently, I mainly focused on constructing an explicit reasoning framework enhanced by external knowledge base. Previously, I graduated from Harbin Institute of Technology, Computer Science, in 2022.

PS: I am working as an intern at Foundation Research Center, PCG, Tencent.



# Research
        
I am generally interested in natural language processing and machine learning. Current interests are on several aspects around large language models: 
- parameter-efficient tuning -- efficiency, modular, composition 
- multi-step reasoning
- factuality -- method and evaluation
- evaluation of foundation models -- knowledge, reasoning, tool use, etc.
- data-centric approaches 
- language model as agent
